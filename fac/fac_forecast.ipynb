Most of the reported slides came from the Flathead Range and southern Glacier National Park. What was notable about this activity was that experienced riders were surprised by remotely-triggered avalanches, avalanches breaking wider than expected, and some avalanches wrapping around to different slope aspects. These are characteristics of a Persistent Slab problem, rather than a Storm Slab. Observers identified that these slides were primarily on shaded aspects (northwest, north, and east) and that the 8 to 12 inches of new snow failed on a layer of faceted grains, at the interface of new and old snow.\\xa0\\nWe removed the Wind Slab problem in the Swan and the Whitefish Range, given that these areas received less snow and winds have been generally light over the past 48 hours. Pockets of isolated wind slabs may still lurk along the side of ridgelines. Pay attention to dune-shaped pillows of snow and steer clear of these drifts.\\nSince then, the snowpack is trending towards increasingly stable conditions, with some uncertainty about how long this persistent weak layer will be reactive. Given the current unsettled weather pattern of a mix of sun, clouds, convective snow showers, and below-normal ambient air temperatures, today’s avalanche hazards run a wide range of possibilities. As you travel, you may encounter localized weather that is isolated to a relatively small area.\\xa0 If the sun does come out for an extended period, wet instabilities are possible. On the other end of the spectrum, light snow accumulations from convective precipitation may add unconsolidated snow to our weekend's accumulations. Additionally, if moderate southwest winds develop, new snow may build drifts of dense snow. These wind slabs may be small, but still capable of knocking the unsuspecting rider off their feet.\\xa0\\nWith this in mind, we hope that in the final week of our daily forecasts for the 2022-2023 winter season, our community members have the tools and information needed to adjust travel plans based on changing conditions.

Two avalanches resulted in people getting caught and carried in large slides, and another avalanche resulted in a close call. The amount of recent snow plays a key role in the avalanche problems and variability among the forecast zone.\\nFlathead Range/Glacier National Park\\nWe transition to a Persistent Slab Problem in the Flathead Range/Glacier National Park due to travel advice and the grain type that avalanches are failing on. More snow fell, which resulted in avalanches failing in wind-sheltered and wind-loaded terrain. Although slabs are relatively soft, they are behaving more like a Persistent Slab than your run-of-the-mill storm snow avalanche problem. For example, my party triggered an avalanche that propagated 600 feet wide, wrapped around a sharp ridgeline, and put debris down into two separate drainages (observation). Other parties remotely triggered avalanches, with one slide stepping down to a deeper buried weak layer (observation).\\xa0\\nWe are uncertain how long this problem may linger, but we suspect avalanches will remain reactive to the weight of a person for the near future.\\xa0\\nWhitefish Range/Swan Range\\nGenerally speaking, not enough snow fell to form a slab in the Whitefish Range and the Swan Range. However, sustained winds drifted the few inches of snow into small slabs on the downwind side of ridges and gullies. Slabs of drifted snow may still be reactive to the weight of a rider, but likely small in size and confined to wind-drifted features. I would expect to see slides similar to the ones found in this observation. These should be easy to manage by giving them a wide berth and by sticking to wind-sheltered slopes.\\xa0\\nWe received no observations from the Swan Range, giving us a slightly higher degree of uncertainty there.

A poor snowpack structure lead to some impressively wide and destructive avalanches above 5000 feet, especially in the Flathead Range. Large hard slabs were just observed in the northern Whitefish Range. Since the atmospheric river, strong winds from varying directions have thickened and stiffened slabs above persistent weak layers. \\nThere are challenges to managing a Persistent Slab problem.

Slabs, especially where they are hardened by wind, can break far above you and be nearly impossible to escape. We are on a trend toward this problem becoming unlikely to trigger, but recent signs of instability are making us leary of that transition just yet.

One major takeaway from these incidents was that both groups didn't experience signs of instability before these avalanches, and both slabs were on slopes with relatively minimal wind drifting. Both avalanches were in relatively benign terrain with slope angles between 32-38 degrees in steepness.\\xa0\\nBuried weak layers exist throughout the forecast area. Steady loading from snow and wind may cause these layers to fail, leading to a large and destructive avalanche. Due to the uncertainty around persistent slabs, the safest bet during a loading period is to offer slopes that harbor these weak layers a wide margin for error. We can do that by avoiding slopes steeper than 30 degrees.\\xa0\"}\n",

Two large wind slab avalanches were spotted in steep, rocky terrain. Both propagated wide and ran far. Shooting cracks were experienced on wind-affected slopes. In the same neighborhood, I found up to 12 inches of loose, dry snow in sheltered locations that is faceting due to the dry weather. However, anything open and exposed to the wind was a different story. Windward slopes were scoured, and cross-loaded pitches had a wind crust that was occasionally tough to navigate.

We also noted shooting cracks in freshly formed wind slabs and blowing snow.\\nSunny slopes sheltered from the wind received solar warming and softened as the day progressed. Rollerballs and moist surface snow developed. Cool temperatures overnight should result in a crust at low and mid elevations this morning. We are unsure how high the crust extends, but the WMR (6730\\') station reached 32F for a couple of hours yesterday afternoon.\\xa0\\n\\xa0A Pacific cold front moves into the Flathead Monday and Tuesday with a decent shot of snow and wind. The snow will fall on various surfaces, including weak faceted surface snow, melt-freeze crusts, and stiff wind-affected snow. These surfaces may inhibit bonding with the new snow.

We anticipate rising danger if the storm delivers as advertised.\\nTunnel Ridge Weather Station: A huge thank you to Two Bear Air and the BNSF Avalanche team for their work to get this station up and running. The wind tower was destroyed in the fall during a strong wind event. The associated snow station survived in a lower, more sheltered spot but needed the wind station to transmit data. Two Bear Air flew in the replacement parts as a community service. We are so fortunate to have this resource in the Flathead Valley. Hooray for Two Bear!

This failed at approximately 5000 feet. This slide caught and carried 2 of the riders, dragging them 150 feet and over a small cliff. No riders were injured. We thank the party involved for sharing this event. This is bullseye information for us to help keep us out of harm's way today.\\xa0\\nWeather:\\nLast night's storm was forecasted to favor the southern end of our forecast zone, but it didn’t quite materialize. Noisy Basin in the Swan Range picked up .3 inches of snow water equivalent (SWE), which resulted in 1 to 3 inches of snow. Other remote weather stations throughout the forecast area are showing 1 to 2 inches of new snow overnight.\\nWind speeds out of the southwest are back at it and blowing at speeds capable of transporting snow in all three forecast zones. Wind speeds for the past four days were unusually windy. South and southwest winds reached sustained speeds in the moderate to extreme categories.\\nSnowpack:\\nThe theme of recent observations is wind-affected surfaces. Observations paint a picture of wind-scoured surfaces on windward slopes, and slabs of drifted snow on wind-loaded slopes. Reports of natural and human-triggered avalanches involving wind-drifted snow continue to trickle in. These ranged in size from small (harmless to a human) to large (large enough to bury and injure a human).\\nWeak layers exist in the upper snowpack throughout our forecast area. Weak snow is now getting buried deep in the Swan Range, making it more difficult to trigger. Propagation in snowpit tests and active loading makes us hesitant to drop the likelihood for now. A facet/crust combination in the Flathead Range is showing untrustworthy signs in snowpit tests. So far, we have no confirmed avalanches on this weak layer. We suspect it may be the culprit in a recent human-triggered avalanche. Persistent weak layers of surface hoar and facets exist in the Whitefish Range, but are not showing signs of it being a problem yet. So far, we contribute this to the lack of snow resting on weak layers. A loading event may bring this back to listing it as a problem.\\xa0\\nTerrain:\\nThe primary avalanche problem to manage right now is wind slabs. You can manage this problem by searching for snow sheltered from the wind. This may require more searching due to strong winds. Further down the slope and in treed terrain may be a good place to start looking. The higher you climb and the closer you get to ridgelines, the more likely it is you’ll find a wind slab.\\nPersistent weak layers are more of a concern on the same aspects where winds are drifting snow into thicker slabs. This does simplify our terrain selection. Treat slopes on north through east aspects as suspects for wind slabs and persistent slabs. Reduce your chance of getting caught in a slide by reducing your slope angle to less than 35 degrees on those aspects.\\xa0\\nCome one, come all!\\xa0Flathead\\xa0Avalanche\\xa0Friends Fest, a four-day festival from Feb 8-11, has a full schedule with mini-clinics, a keynote speaker, après, and a Big-A$$ Raffle.

South and southwest winds varied between moderate to extreme and wreaked havoc on slopes open to the wind. I went searching for wind-affected terrain Saturday and Sunday and found it. Areas open to the wind, both windward and leeward, were \"messed up.\" The surface was scoured down to a hard layer in locations taking the brunt of the wind head-on. Snowfields, where the wind was moving across or up a slope, had a dense surface that kept my skis from sinking more than a few inches.

Fortunately, winds were diminishing and have decreased to a more tolerable level this morning.\\xa0 \\xa0\\nFollowing Friday's snowfall, the winds have been the driving force in avalanche danger. Wind slab has returned to the top of the problem list as these atypical winds form slabs in unusual locations. The amount of new snow available for transport varies widely across the area. The recent storm favored the Swan Range with 2 inches of SWE, while the Whitefish Range picked up less than 0.5 inches. We do not have an operating weather station in the Flathead Range, but observations point toward totals slightly more than what was recorded in the Whitefish Range.\\nIn areas sheltered from the wind, sluffing in the surface snow is to be expected. The cold temperatures are faceting this snow and making it less cohesive and weaker. In some locations, this snow rests on a crust that inhibits bonding and allows sluffs to travel further than expected. This problem is confined to steep terrain, generally above 38 degrees, and is most dangerous in long-running gullies or lengthy sustained pitches.\\xa0\\nCome one, come all!\\xa0Flathead\\xa0Avalanche\\xa0Friends Fest, a four-day festival from Feb 8-11, has a full schedule with mini-clinics, a keynote speaker, après, and a Big-A$$ Raffle.

As we’ve shared since listing the Persistent Slab problem on 1/18/2023, figuring out the distribution of this “spotty” layer has proven challenging. Building on what we know, we can add that both teams did not observe instabilities associated with the buried weak layer.\\nObservation Highlights from Wednesday:\\n\\nProfessional Observer-Guy and FOFAC’s Education Coordinator Meg toured the Northern Whitefish Range, catching a beautiful inversion day with lots of sunshine. When they searched and dug in the snowpack, rather than finding buried surface hoar, they discovered that the 3 to 5 inches of new snow resting on the stout, supportable MLK crust was evidence to enjoy skiing some steeper slopes.\\nCam and his partner also did not find evidence of the buried weak layer in the Essex area of the Flathead Range. They climbed up to 7600 feet and were spooked by a south-facing slope that was shallow in snow depth, with large depth hoar crystals. Using that information, they chose not to ski that southern slope and instead chose a west-facing pitch with a hard, supportable crust that did not have evidence of a buried weak layer.\\n\\nIt is important to note that there is still uncertainty about the reactivity of the buried weak layer in the Swan Range. Additionally, the Swan Range is favored to receive higher snow accumulation totals from Friday’s incoming storm. The remotely triggered avalanche from last Saturday (1/21/23) in the Swan should still be considered a warning that we can not write off the potential for triggering an avalanche on a buried weak layer.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nMotorized Partner Rescue - Join us for an eight-hour field day on Saturday, January 28, 2023.

This is the same reason why forecasting for buried surface hoar (Persistent Slab problem) is challenging. Before surface hoar gets buried by new snow, winds can break apart the crystals or sun can melt the crystals, leaving irregular patches of surface hoar within a given slope. This is why spatial variation of surface hoar can be difficult to map. So far our data suggests that the sun and wind have destroyed this tricky weak layer on South and West aspects, prior to it getting buried. Given the uncertainty, the safest strategy to manage this problem is with a wide margin of error and conservative terrain choices.\\nThe good news is that there is fun skiing and riding to be had in all three forecast zones.

We are entering a particularly dangerous time in the Swan Range where slabs are growing thicker and more dangerous, but the persistent weak layer the slab rests on is still at depths where a human can collapse it, causing a large avalanche.\\xa0 The culprit is a weak layer of surface hoar.\\xa0\\nSo far, this problem is a different story in the Whitefish Range, Flathead Range, and southern Glacier National Park. A few reasons why it is different there:\\n\\nSignificantly less snow has fallen there. Snow water equivalents (SWE) range from 1.4 to 1.7 inches vs. the Swan Range is now at 4.6 inches of SWE since January 9th.\\nA storm on January 9th almost entirely favored the Swan Range with 8 to 12 inches of snow. This snow buried the surface hoar there, while leaving it exposed for a longer period of time in other ranges. The longer that surface hoar is exposed, the greater the chance it will get destroyed by wind and sun.\\nSo far, buried surface hoar is proving difficult to find in the Whitefish and Flathead Ranges. We’ve found it on a northwest-facing slope at 7400 feet, and others did not find it in a nearby location on a similar aspect, but lower in elevation. The \"spotty\" nature of this problem makes forecasting particularly difficult.\\n\\nManaging this problem is easy in the Swan Range. Our advice is to avoid steep slopes on shaded aspects, those are ones that face North and East. For the Whitefish Range, the Flathead Range, and southern Glacier National Park, all the data suggests it is unreactive. Most of this information comes from below 7000 feet. Generally, we found this layer weaker at upper elevations, leading to a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty for terrain above that.\\nAs Mark wrote yesterday, an “underperforming” cold front rolled through the Flathead Saturday night. Winds were generally light, with the exception of Hornett in the northern Whitefish Range and Marias Pass in the Flathead Range. Both stations reached ideal speeds for transporting snow into slabs. Wind speeds increased overnight at Link Mountain, averaging 13 mph with gusts up to 26 mph. Westerly winds are yet again forecasted to blow at ideal speeds for transporting snow.\\n\\xa0'}\n",

Most mid-elevation weather stations received minimal accumulations overnight, with very light snowfall expected through the day today. Wind speeds associated with the front have been much lower than forecast, but there has been enough of an uptick to drive today\\'s avalanche danger. Because of the discrepancy in recent precipitation totals and the distribution of weak layers, we continue to divide the avalanche forecast into two groups - team Swan Range and team everywhere else.\\nA huge shout-out to the stellar group of experienced riders who continue to submit observations on this website. We received nine comments from familiar faces Saturday, which helped immensely as FAC staff has had limited field time due to either illness or obligations instructing avalanche classes.\\nSwan Range: Wind speeds at the Aeneas Ridge (7186\\') weather station have averaged just below the threshold for snow transport over the past 24 hours. However, moderate to strong hourly gusts have been recorded during that same time frame, drifting snow into slabs on leeward aspects. This area has picked up 2-3 times more recent snow than the other zones, and we expect the fetches to provide plenty of snow for transport throughout the day. We have moved Wind Slab to Problem 1 in this range.\\n\\nIn the Swan Range yesterday, a rider experienced a collapse and shooting crack in the recent snow while third in line ascending a slope. The slope was steep enough to slide but it did not. This individual mentioned feeling humbled and unnerved. The photo of the crack was submitted with the on-point caption, \"That means go away.\" Other observations from the Swan included less scary avalanche problems, such as Loose Dry sluffs on steep sunny mid-elevation aspects running several hundred feet. These sluffs were probably running on top of a crust formed during the January 13 warm-up. Anticipate triggering a sluff on very steep terrain today in aspects sheltered from the wind.\\n\\nWhitefish Range, Flathead Range, southern Glacier Park: Wind speeds at the Snowslip (7000\\') weather station in the John F. Stevens corridor were sustained light with moderate to strong gusts over the past 24 hours. The Flathead Range does not have a working wind sensor. The Hornet station reports light winds with moderate gusts in the northern Whitefish Range, while the Link Mountain station remains rimed. Despite the relatively low wind speeds, we have moved the Wind Slab to problem 1 in both zones.\\n\\nRiders in the central and northern Whitefish Range reported long-running sluffs in the 10-15 cm of loose surface snow on top of the 1-19 rime crust. Expect more of these sluffs to be triggered today in steep terrain. One rider side hilled short 40+ degree slopes and saw no signs of instability.\\nObservers in the Flathead Range also noted sluffing in the top 10-15 cm on top of a crust. Expect more of these sluffs to be triggered in steep terrain today. They found soft, drifted snow 8-10\" thick on leeward slopes and leeward sides of gullies at upper elevations—no cracking or signs of sensitivity, but noticeable enough to affect their terrain choices.\\n\\nToday\\'s danger ratings:\\xa0We have reasonable confidence in bumping the danger rating in the Swan to CONSIDERABLE at upper elevations or above 6500 feet. Higher wind speeds and more available snow for transport make this a relatively easy call. We are bumping the danger at mid-elevations, 5000-6500 feet, to MODERATE in the Whitefish Range, the Flathead Range, and southern Glacier Park. We are not confident that wind speeds at this elevation and the little snow available for transport will allow slabs of wind-drifted snow to form.

There is evidence of these weak layers in the other ranges, but they do not seem as widespread or well-developed. The presence or absence of buried weak layers combined with the amount of recently fallen snow is responsible for the discrepancy in our avalanche danger ratings.\\xa0\\nSwan Range:\\xa0Yesterday's dry weather and light winds, combined with today's dry daylight forecast, allow us to drop the danger rating at upper elevations to MODERATE on NW-NE-SE aspects.

Mid-elevation weather stations in the Whitefish Range and southern Glacier Park received virtually nothing. Unfortunately, the Tunnel Ridge station remains down, and we don\\'t know if there was \"spillover precipitation\" in the Flathead Range. Occasionally, moisture-laden storms on southwest flow do not drop all of their precipitation in the Swan but instead drop what is left on the next formidable barrier to the east, such as the Flathead Crest.\\xa0\\nSwan Range: The new load increased the danger in the Swan yesterday afternoon, and I suspect natural sluffing and Loose Dry slides occurred, along with possibly a few storm slabs. There were no observations from the Swan yesterday, and we don\\'t know if the new load tipped the balance and triggered larger slides on the buried weak layers. Today, the natural avalanche activity is over; however, the chance of triggering a slide on a buried weak layer has increased from earlier in the week. Due to uncertainty with the buried weak layer, and a subsequent conservative mindset, we have bumped the danger up today as we let the snowpack adjust to this loading event. The danger is CONSIDERABLE on slopes above roughly 6500 feet, harboring the buried weak layer (NW-NE-SE). Expect the risk to decrease to a MODERATE rating tomorrow in this terrain. We added the storm slab to the problem list on all aspects at mid and upper elevations. This has increased the danger of the windward and sunny aspects to MODERATE.\\xa0 Storm slabs generally heal quickly; we may drop this rating to LOW tomorrow.\\nWhitefish Range, Flathead Range, southern Glacier Park: Light winds and the lack of precipitation keep the avalanche danger steady in the Whitefish Range and southern Glacier Park. Probably the Flathead Range as well. In these areas, slabs resting on weak snow are not being tested like in the Swan Range. Slabs remain thin, and the risk of triggering a slide on a buried weak layer may decrease slightly during these calm conditions.\\xa0\\n\\nBlase was in the side country of WMR searching for buried surface hoar, which he and his partner did not find. Multiple pits at mid-elevations revealed weak interfaces in the upper ~75 cm of the snowpack, but none propagated in tests.\\xa0 They were surprised to trigger several sluffs on steep, north-facing, mid-elevation slopes involving the 4 cm of new snow. These ran surprisingly far and could be a hazard in areas with more snow above the 1/19 rime crust.\\nThe USGS was in John F. Stevens Canyon, where they found buried decomposing surface hoar on sheltered N and NE aspects at 6800\\' down to 5500\\' ~20cm below the surface. They stomped small fresh, touchy cornices around 6800 feet with no meaningful results. The surface hoar in their snowpits was unreactive in tests, but there is not much of a slab above it yet.\\n\\nToday and Saturday will offer benign weather conditions of seasonable temperatures, light winds, and mostly dry conditions. This weather pattern will continue to help our Persistent Slab problem improve slightly in many areas and allow the snowpack time to adjust to the recent loading event in the Swan. The next weather system will impact the area overnight Saturday into Sunday with up to 6 inches of new snow in favored locations. This storm may help build a thicker slab on top of the near-surface weak layer in the Flathead and Whitefish Range and may be another loading event that will test our buried weak layers.\\nEducation:\\xa0Human-Powered Partner Rescue - Join us for an eight-hour field day on Saturday, January 21, 2023.

A widespread weak layer in the upper snowpack is responsible for natural and triggered slides along with propagation in snowpit tests. You can find this layer across shady, sheltered slopes (NW-NE-SE), where it survived the effects of recent wind and sun.\\xa0\\nSwan Range: Over the past nine days, this area has been favored by recent storms, with 3.2 inches of SWE and over a foot of settled snow at the Noisy Basin SNOTEL. The buried weak layer is generally twice as deep here as in the other ranges. Above about 5500 feet, this layer may be found 16-24” below the surface. It consists of a thin layer of feathery surface hoar and faceted grains, which may appear as a grey stripe in the pit wall. Cam and Guy found this layer to propagate in snowpit tests yesterday on the east side of the Swan Crest (Observation). Triggering an avalanche on this layer in sheltered or wind-loaded terrain may result in a slide large enough to bury, injure, or kill a rider. Rob was in the Mid-Swan yesterday and could not find surface hoar in a dozen hand pits on an exposed westerly ridge (Observation). He noted large surface hoar in the neighborhood last week but surmised that the wind and sun destroyed this pesky layer where he traveled.\\nThe other ranges: The remainder of the advisory area has received far less recent snow, and the layer is found 6-12” below the surface above about 6500’. The weak snow layer is also located below that elevation, but the lack of a slab limits the problem currently. Areas where you could initiate a slide on the weak layer appear to be limited to wind-loaded slopes, as evidenced by this observation from the northern Whitefish Range. Down the road: Additional snowfall may form a more widespread surface slab prompting us to expand this problem to the mid-elevation band.\\xa0\\nChristmas Crust weak snow: In late December, light snow fell on top of the Christmas Atmospheric River rain crust. The first week of January was cool and dry, contributing to faceting in this snow. Incremental loading occurred over the past ten days. We now have a 2-3 foot thick slab resting on this weak layer. The BNSF Avalanche Safety Team reported propagation on this deep layer earlier this week. Cam noted natural slides, which may have failed on this layer during last Friday’s warmup. We are more concerned about the weak layer closer to the surface, but as the surface slab thickens, this crust-facet combination may come into play and become an additional Persistent Slab.\\xa0\\nManaging the Persistent Slab Problem: Avalanches failing on surface hoar or facets may break wider than expected or higher on the slope above you. Remotely triggered slides occurred this past week in the Swan, and today you could start a slide from gentler terrain above, below, or to the side of steeper slopes. Triggered slides in wind-drifted snow occurred this week in the Swan and northern Whitefish. If you plan on recreating NW-NE-SE slopes in the near future, choose lower-angled pitches free of overhead hazards to mitigate this problem. If this layer is present in a hand pit or snowpit, choose a different aspect or stick to lower-angle terrain. Buried surface hoar and facets are not to be trusted and should be given a wide berth. Slopes that face the sun or wind do not appear to harbor this weak layer and will offer a safer alternative.'}\n",

The 4 to 20 inches of snow faceted on many shaded aspects at the beginning of January. During that time, photos of feathery surface hoar trickled in. The sun shined and warmed solar aspects, cooking the snow surface and forming a thin sun crust. This is what all the recent snow is resting on.\\nObservations from all three regions show a developing Persistent Slab avalanche problem. We made the transition to calling it that in the Swan Range, where enough snow piled up above these weak layers for it to be problematic. The BNSF Avalanche Safety Program found propagating pit results on faceted snow above the Christmas Crust, which is now buried roughly 22 inches below the surface.

On January 11th, an observer found it buried under 6 inches of snow and reactive in snowpit tests at 6000 feet. A snowmobiler remotely triggered a large slab avalanche below a ridgeline that same day (observation). Yesterday, my partner and I found evidence of natural slab avalanches that failed sometime in the last week. We remotely triggered two slabs while walking a ridgeline (observation). We were surprised at how sensitive this weak layer remained, a week after its burial. These are clear signs to avoid shaded aspects where winds drifted snow into thicker slabs, and that this problem may stick with us for a while.\\nAlthough slabs are failing on a persistent weak layer, we plan to list them as a Wind Slab problem for the next couple of days, as we collect more information. As of right now, we are more concerned about areas where there is enough snow to form a slab above this fragile weak layer. So far, that is where winds have drifted snow.\\xa0\\xa0'}\n",

The decision was not made lightly and was made as a forecast team. As we’ve discussed in many of our previous forecasts, this is a complex problem that is challenging to predict, as well as manage.\\xa0\\nOur discussion started with a review of the time that has passed since we have observed or received reports of avalanches and/or instabilities associated with the mid-November buried weak layer. The last collapse reported occurred almost a week ago (January 6) at a mid-elevation slope, in the southern Whitefish Range. Roughly two weeks ago, Cam experienced a loud collapse (December 28) in the Swan Range. The last avalanches that failed on this layer were during the Christmas rain event. Since the Christmas rain event, we have received a total of 96 observations.\\xa0\\nWhich brings us to the second consideration: the crust. The Santa Soaker, aka the atmospheric river that soaked the area and then froze to create the stout Christmas Crust complex, ultimately limits our ability to impact the buried persistent weak layer, where it exists. Given the observations that the Christmas Crust extends to upper elevations along with the time that has passed, we removed the Persistent weak layer, as a current problem. It is important to keep in mind that there is still a lingering potential to trigger this weak layer in areas with a shallow snowpack. Given the total number of observations, lack of signs of instability, and the stout Christmas Crust, we feel it is now very unlikely to trigger this weak layer.'}\n",

Depending on how you look at it, this is either pretty good or bad. Regardless, these are unusual avalanche conditions for early January. One observer compared instability in our snowpack to open parking spaces in a popular lot at WMR, \"Harder to find than a parking spot in Larch lot.\" It has been a week since our area\\'s last measurable snow, resulting in these stagnant avalanche conditions.\\nWe received 9 public observations Saturday. Thank you! Sustained sunshine warmed sunny slopes at all elevation bands for the first time since the Atmospheric River impacted us over the holidays. Observers reported rollerballs developing around noon, with a rider on Big Slide in the southern Whitefish Range noting a waterfall of rollerballs and pinwheels with sticky snow below 4000 feet. I was in southern Glacier Park, where I viewed heavily rimed trees warming and shedding their winter coat with ice chunks trundling down the hill. However, we did not receive any reports of rollerballs triggering Loose Wet slides. Sarah, Meg, and Woody taught an avalanche class to our local Search and Rescue teams in Kimmerly Basin, where they observed riders triggering small, harmless, Loose Dry sluffs in very steep terrain.\\xa0\\nThis morning, expect to find a thin melt-freeze crust on aspects warmed by Saturday\\'s sunshine. I found moist snow up to 7500\\' in areas protected from the wind. An observer noted that Saturday\\'s wind kept the snow surface cool on an upper-elevation westerly aspect, so at least we have that going for us. Loose-dry faceted snow can still be found in areas sheltered by wind and sun. In windward terrain, you may encounter fields of rime from the recent fog and cloud deck that has recently socked in the upper elevations. I was impressed by how widespread and well-developed the layer of rime was on Elk Mountain.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSaturday\\'s observations from the alpine noted little to no wind transport of snow. In most locations, wind speeds were just below the threshold needed to drift snow, with snow available for transport decreasing due to warming temperatures, rime, and previous wind. However, an experienced rider backed off his party\\'s steep objective after encountering knee-deep drifted snow at 5800\\'. Continue to check out slopes for pockets of wind slab before committing.\\xa0\\nDespite another day of \"green light\" conditions, we recommend following safe travel protocols of just one person on a slope at a time while the remainder of the group watches this individual.

First, we were too cold, then too rainy, and now we’re looking dismally dry for the foreseeable future. I know I’m a complainer, but here’s why:\\nPeriods of dry weather are the origin story for snowpack villains: persistent weak layers. When combined with cold temperatures, unconsolidated snow can rapidly facet into a weak, sugary layer. This “recycled powder” makes for decent riding when it’s on the surface. However, once it’s buried, the resulting structure can be unstable. We needn’t look any further than our familiar November Facet layer for an example of this phenomenon.\\xa0\\nNearly half of this season’s SWE at Noisy Basin fell between October 21st and November 6th. The next notable snowfall started on November 22nd, a dry spell of roughly 16 days. Faceting was rampant during this time due to the early season, shallow snowpack, and unseasonably cold temperatures. Once covered, the old snow interface was immediately reactive, and we had a persistent slab problem that confined us to slopes less than 35 degrees until a rain crust capped it well into upper elevations. Now our attention turns to the snow above this crust.\\xa0\\nWe’re on day seven of the current dry weather regime. This period also started with below seasonal temps. Unsurprisingly, observations have reported faceting above the crust, mainly where the surface snow layer is thinnest. Facet/crust combinations can be particularly troublesome. Although temperatures have since moderated – and are forecasted to remain at or above seasonal averages – we want to acknowledge the possibility of near-surface faceting and its future impact on stability.\\xa0\\nAlso worth keeping in mind is the potential for surface hoar. These feathery crystals grow on the snow surface during nights with clear skies and calm wind. Surface hoar can support an impressive amount of weight, allowing large slabs to form on top of it. However,\\xa0 once a shear load - like that of a skier or rider - is applied, the crystals fall over like dominos causing the snow above to avalanche. Surface hoar is easily destroyed by the sun or wind, so it will often lurk in sheltered terrain, though it can be found anywhere if it is quickly covered by new snow.\\nKeep an eye out for facets and surface hoar during these drying times, and let us know what you find.\\xa0'}\n",

And whether a breakable crust was present at the snow surface. In both cases, a \"not a crust\" answer would mean the potential for triggering avalanches that would or could be dangerous.\\nOn most slopes below about 7400 feet, storms at Christmas deposited ice lenses or refrozen melt-freeze snow that are now covered by 4 to 20 inches of snow. These very hard layers drastically reduce the chances a person could collapse weak snow buried in mid December or late November. You can find those layers roughly mid-snowpack and near the ground, respectively.\\nThe mid-December layer has shown up recently as a thin (1 cm) thick stripe of rounding facets and surface hoar that sometimes propagates with hard force in extended column tests (here and here). It was likely the failure plane for several very large avalanches that released last week, including one Rob and Guy checked out near Link Mountain in the Whitefish Range Wednesday. The late-November layers present as 4-finger hard, rounding facets 12-20 inches above the ground, or as rounding depth hoar above an ice lens at the same depth. I find the latter structure more concerning.\\nMany riders are reporting that last week\\'s snow is faceting in this week\\'s cold, dry conditions. Nights with few clouds - like Wednesday night - are accelerating this process. The near-surface snow is becoming cohesionless, so the potential for triggering sluffs of loose, dry snow is growing.

It can be, however, on very steep (40 degrees or more) slopes without a crust at the surface. That\\'s mostly terrain that faces northwest through north to northeast above about 6500 feet. That\\'s also the kind of terrain where many people explore during Low-danger conditions like now.

And only 5 reports of instability in the past week. Most of these are minor (a cornice fall avalanche in the Flathead Range, isolated cracking in the northern Whitefish Range, cracking cornices in southern Glacier NP). The most significant was Cam's report of loud, booming collapses in the northern Swan Range on Dec. 28.\\xa0\\nThe value of submitting observations. We've got a pretty clear picture of conditions across the region at all elevations thanks to all the riders who've taken the time to fill out the observation form.\\xa0\\n\\nBased on those observations, we're dropping the danger to Low at all elevations across the region. There are few reports of slabs and failure planes in the near-surface snowpack. It's unlikely the weight of a rider or snowmachine will trigger an avalanche that breaks on weak snow buried near the base of the snowpack. That's largely due to the ice lenses and melt-freeze crusts near the surface of the snowpack. These layers are hard and supportable and extend to at least 7400 feet, with one report of these ice layers up to 7700 feet. They limit the likelihood of a rider or snowmachine collapsing the basal layers. It's also because the weak layers themselves are rounding and sintering as the snowpack deepens.\\nThere are, of course, isolated exceptions. These are slopes where the ice or crusts are weak and don't support the weight of a rider, or where they're thin and the track of a snowmachine at high RPM can slice through them. The persistent slab structure seems to have been most developed on mid-elevation, sunny slopes, because of sun that created hard crusts and strong temperature gradients above that promoted facet and depth hoar growth. The few confirmed reports of avalanches failing on the basal weak layer released on slopes like these. And the only reports (here and here) of this layer propagating in the past week are slopes like these, both east of WMR. Thanks to an unusually cold early season, upper elevations slopes saw little warming and the weak snow doesn't seem to be as developed, with no ice crust.\\xa0\\nAfter light winds for the most of the past week, there have been few reports of wind-drifted snow and slabs. You might find a few unstable drifts in the terrain most prone to collecting wind-blown snow, like the tops of chutes and couloirs.\\xa0\\nWe have received multiple reports of open glide cracks. They've been sighted in the southern Whitefish Range, the Swan Range, and the Flathead Range. They likely exist because the ground was still warm when first buried by snow in late October. They tend to fail randomly, so it's best to stay out from under them.\\xa0\\nMonday's snow left a thin but rideable crust at the surface on many slopes, with some reports of thin rime crusts.

Thin spots develop where winds scour away snow and drift it elsewhere. One thing to note is we’ve had long stretches of both northeasterly and southwesterly winds.

The crust varies in thickness and strength but is generally several inches thick and supportable to someone on skis. Because it supports our weight, it limits our ability to affect the weak layers buried in mid-November.\\n-Due to the continued development of our snowpack, the weak layers are deeply buried and up to 3 meters below the snow surface. Generally speaking, our ability to affect layers through our weight is confined to the top meter of snow.\\n-The weight of the overlying snowpack is compressing the weak layers. This is a strengthening process where pore space is reduced, and the crystal shape may change from angular to round.\\n-A deepening snowpack generally reduces the temperature gradient in the pack. A smaller gradient is\\xa0a strengthening process that changes the crystal shape toward a more rounded appearance. Round crystals can pack together tighter and thus become a stronger layer.\\nThe number of slopes below 6500 feet where you could trigger an avalanche of a buried mid-November weak layer has been significantly reduced.

Most groups noted recent snow totals between 4-18 inches resting on a stout crust formed during last week's rain event. This crust extends to 7200 feet in the Flathead Range, where light to moderate winds transported small amounts of snow, forming isolated small wind slabs. The only signs of instability reported were a bit of cracking in the new snow, one small cornice collapse, and minor collapsing at 6000 feet.\\nWith a New Year upon us, let's look at Snow Water Equivalent amounts for the early 2022-23 winter season. Even though it appears that we are having a banner year, the Flathead Basin is barely above the 1991-2020 median. The FAC forecast area contains 5 SNOTEL sites at low and mid-elevations.

All sites are at or just above the median, with Noisy reporting the highest at 126%.\\nEach Friday, FAC publishes a written Weekly Conditions Summary which can be found in a tab adjacent to the Weather Forecast tab.

These slides ran far and wide with debris covering runout zones. As the atmospheric river continued, the following cycle of slides consisted of large D3, destructive wet loose avalanches.

The Wind Slab problem is also generally decreasing due to light winds throughout our forecast area. The Persistent Slab problem is still with us, as Cam observed on Wednesday.

We've rated it as HIGH, though we expect those conditions to develop late in the day and possibly overnight.\\nAn atmospheric river is set to impact our forecast region today, with rain levels reaching 6000 feet. This elevation will vary throughout the day and the forecast region. The main uncertainties of the day are: What elevation will we see rain? How much rain will fall before it turns to snow? What kind of surface will rain fall on?\\nTypically, the most direct-action avalanche cycle we can experience is the initial onset of rain on a dry snowpack. This creates nearly instant and widespread avalanching. The primary ingredients to this are obviously rain, but also the liquid water content at the surface and surface texture. A dry, unconsolidated snow surface would lead to a more unstable snowpack. On the flip side, avalanches may not be as predictable when surfaces have already become moist or if there is a crust. In order for it to avalanche in this scenario, it typically requires more rain to wet the snow surface or break down the crust. This is where we have a lot of variability and uncertainty throughout the forecast area.\\nWe have confirmed reports of a thick freezing rain crust in the valley floor of the Middle Fork. This crust formed on Christmas Eve. Since then, we’ve received nearly consistent rain at lower elevations. This crust may have already broken down due to rainfall. We received reports of blowing snow at 6000 feet on Christmas Day in John F. Stevens Canyon, leading us to believe the rain crust does not extend to that elevation. I observed a dry snowpack above roughly 5200 feet in the southern Whitefish Range. A number of reports in the middle elevation band described the snow surface as “upside down,” meaning harder over softer snow. Blase observed moist snow between 5000-6000 feet in the Middle Fork on Christmas Eve. Areas that have a crust or are moist may not avalanche as quickly as areas that still hold a dry snowpack.\\xa0\\nGiven a high degree of uncertainty regarding liquid water content and the precipitation forecast, we rated the avalanche danger HIGH at middle elevations. Whether we see a widespread natural avalanche cycle today or not feels like a crap shoot. The consequences are not worth wagering. We strongly recommend avoiding all avalanche terrain today.\\xa0\"}\n",

The turnaround in temperatures is remarkable, with most locations seeing readings 50-60 F higher than experienced Thursday. As of 0200 this morning, most mid-elevation weather stations are on either side of freezing, with the upper-elevation stations in the mid to upper 20s. Colder air is still trapped in some valley locations and is responsible for the dreaded freezing rain experienced Saturday afternoon and overnight.\\nMany locations picked up around 1 inch of SWE over the past 48 hours, with Flattop, in central Glacier Park, bringing home the lion's share with a whopping 2.7 inches. The recent snow has fallen progressively denser over the past two days and is significantly heavier than the incredibly low-density snow it is capping. Blase was in the Marion Lake area Saturday and noted upside-down near-surface conditions at mid-elevations. This surface warmed through the day, became moist, and glopped to skis in the afternoon. Due to the cold air trapped at low elevations, the snow remained dry and softer than experienced at higher elevations. However, there was a rain report in Essex at 5:00 p.m., so that may have changed. Another observer in that general neighborhood noted surface conditions above 6000 feet were more consolidated due to recent wind.\\nSaturday, we bumped the avalanche danger to CONSIDERABLE at all elevations. Extremely cold low-density surface snow was warming rapidly and being loaded by fresh, dense snow. The rapid change in the surface conditions was concerning, as was the uncertainty with the NWS weather forecast. We added Loose Wet as an avalanche problem to the low elevations due to the possibility of rain falling on a cold, dry low-density surface at low elevations. We removed this problem today as the surface became roughed up by warming temperatures, rain, and freezing rain. However, warming temperatures may increase the threat of loose slides as the day progresses.\\nThe snow level is expected to rise Monday into Tuesday, into the mid and possibly upper elevation band. The warming will be accompanied by precipitation which will fall as rain below the snow line. We expect the avalanche danger to increase at all elevation bands across the forecast area.

This week's snowfall remains cold, soft, and available for transport. Forecasted wind speeds should stay below the threshold for drifting Friday.

You may be surprised to learn that the current Snow Water Equivalent for the Flathead Basin is just 109% median for the 1990-2021 period. Don’t get me wrong, 109% is a number that delights me. However, I’m assuming many area residents believe we are enjoying a banner early season with a well-above-typical snowpack. That rationale seems to make sense because the valley floor has snow, the nordic ski areas are open, the WMR opening weekend included nearly all of their terrain, and low-elevation Forest Service roads have plenty of coverage. On top of that, winter does not officially start for another five days! So what gives?\\xa0\\nUndoubtedly, it has been an uncharacteristically colder fall season, than in years past. Our neighbors in Missoula recorded the second coldest period on record from November 1 to December 10. Instead of alternating doses of rain and snow, we’ve enjoyed nearly all snow this autumn. Snow that fell at low elevations has stuck around and not melted from warm temperatures or washed away by rain.\\nHowever, most large storms impacting the western United States have generally gone south of our region and benefitted areas such as the Sierra Nevada, Oregon, the Wasatch, and southern Idaho. In our neighborhood, the southernmost SNOTEL stations reporting a respectable 122% median at Noisy Basin in the Swan Range and 150% at the Blacktail ski area. Unfortunately, the northern mountains have missed the brunt of the precipitation. Flattop in GNP is a paltry 82%, and Stahl Peak in the northern Whitefish Range at 81%.\\xa0\\nWhy this matters. In areas harboring a thin snowpack, the buried faceted weak layer is generally more developed and weaker than in areas harboring a deeper pack. This discrepancy is due to a larger temperature gradient on shallow slopes, which helps drive weak snow development. Also, the slab overlying the weak layers is often thinner and weaker, allowing riders and their snowmachines to affect the buried layers more easily, resulting in whumfing collapses and triggered avalanches.\\xa0\\nTraining:\\xa0Now's a great time to hone your companion rescue skills.\\xa0Transceiver\\xa0parks are open at Whitefish Mountain Resort, one at the summit and one adjacent to Grey Wolf.

Dangerous avalanches on steep slopes are possible right now - not guaranteed or even likely. So riders can venture onto some steep slopes without triggering slabs. They tell their friends. They see tracks from others on steep slopes, without triggered slabs. So it seems normal to ride steep slopes. So more people start riding steep slopes. It\\'s akin to launching a Space Shuttle in temperatures at which data shows an O-ring leaks. Nothing bad happens, so you launch again, and again.

Yet a real potential for a Challenger-like catastrophe, if you hit a spot where the slab is thinner and softer, or the weak layer is less sintered. And there are plenty of spots like that in early-season conditions like this.\\xa0\\nFeedback has continued to be more regular in areas with a shallower snowpack, so it\\'s easier to stop the countdown and call off the launch. The collapses my partner and I experienced Wednesday were nerve-wrackingly loud and long. We repeatedly measured the steepness of the slopes above and around us, and stuck to terrain no more than 30 degrees with limited overhead hazard. We were not deviating from safe practices.\\nThat remains our recommendation - don\\'t deviate from safe travel practices and launch into the terrain where it remains possible to trigger avalanches large enough to bury or injure you. That\\'s regardless of whether you\\'re experiencing signs of instability. The structure remains inherently problematic, and launching onto steep slopes is a lottery, one in which you hope not to lose.\\xa0\\nWe\\'ve dropped the Wind Slab avalanche problem. Any slabs that remain sensitive to a rider\\'s weight or the weight of a snowmachine are isolated. There\\'s plenty of soft snow at the surface, so if winds pick up, expect a new generation of slabs to develop. \\xa0\\nTraining: Now\\'s a great time to hone your companion rescue skills. Transceiver parks are open at Whitefish Mountain Resort, one at the summit and one adjacent to Grey Wolf. Both are accessible to snowmachines.

A storm like this could cause a widespread avalanche cycle that flushes the weak snow out.

This is a slower approach and appears to be the path we\\'re heading towards. Here, the snowpack will become more stable over time as it\\'s weight slowly compresses weak snow near the ground and causes grains to sinter together. Unfortunately cold, arctic air is going to make this process even slower. A large temperature gradient in the snowpack will slow the process of rounding faceted snow near the ground.\\xa0\\n\\nPatience is key.

The rest of the pizza is never as good because the roof of my mouth is scorched. Thankfully, I developed a slower approach to risk in the mountains. This snowpack, like the hot pizza, needs more time before we take a bite. I’ll be waiting for consecutive days of no warning signs before I dive in to steeper terrain.

Still, feedback in the form of whumpfing is a clear sign it remains possible to trigger an avalanche 1-3 feet below the surface.\\nOne group reported a substantial collapse that shook trees up to 200 feet away.

Denser feeling snow will be a clue that the likelihood of triggering a slide has increased from what we've experienced over the past few days.\\nFAC encourages utilizing the terrain to minimize risk while dealing with a Persistent Slab problem. Besides utilizing slope angles, we encourage avoiding convexities because the combination of tension and lack of compressive support increases the chance of an avalanche.\\nThe terrain outside the WMR ski area is easily accessible and draws many folks with limited avalanche knowledge or backcountry experience. There are numerous convexities outside of WMR, but today we will focus on one glaring example. Hellroaring Peak is just west of the current ski area boundary. The sizeable southeast face, visible from chair one, often is covered with ski or snowboard tracks. Most of the face is safe from avalanches due to its moderate slope angle. However, there is a convexity looker right responsible for incidents over the years. The most dramatic was In 1986 when a low snowpack prevented the grooming of the snowmobile trail across the face until February. By then, the old snow on the ground turned to depth hoar or sugar snow. Sure enough, as the groomer started across the road, he collapsed the weak layer and remotely triggered a slide that failed at the convexity. The resulting debris pushed the cat off the road. Fortunately, the operator turned the machine downhill, used his blade to push over small trees, and surfed his way down. The operator was not injured, and after a few repairs, the cat climbed up the debris to the road a week later. Check out these photos for perspective.

While the avalanche danger has slowly decreased since then, we are still dealing with both Persistent Slab and Wind Slab problems.\\nLet’s start with the Wind Slab problem, which is the most immediate. We know from our weather stations that winds Tuesday and Wednesday were strong enough to transport snow and l build slabs. In the last 48 hours, Aeneas Ridge in the Swan Range has recorded southwest winds averaging 24 mph with gusts as high as 44 mph. Other stations have reported lower average wind speeds, though these winds were still capable of transporting snow. The Snowslip station in southern Glacier National Park reported winds from the southeast averaging 11 mph, with gusts up to 28 mph, while the Link weather station in the Whitefish Range had southwest winds averaging 8 mph with strong gusts of 27 mph.\\nWith those wind speeds, we have all the ingredients for building wind slabs along the lee side of ridgelines and gullies. The BNSF avalanche safety team found slabs like these Wednesday in John F. Stevens Canyon. However, their ski cuts on test slopes produced no slides, suggesting these are stubborn. Although we have limited observations at upper elevations, we expect perhaps large and more reactive slabs. Pay attention to changes in the density and the surface texture of the snow to avoid exposing yourself to being caught or triggering a wind slab avalanche.\\nNow, back to our regularly scheduled programming, the Persistent Slab problem.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn Tuesday my partner and I toured east of Whitefish Mountain Resort, with the goal of collecting data on the distribution of the Persistent Slab problem. At mid-elevations, we found that the weak layer was about 18 to 20 inches below the surface and widespread across various aspects. Additionally, we investigated the crown of a triggered avalanche that failed in weak facets resting on a thin crust. The avalanche occurred on a steep slope (40 degrees) with a convex starting zone. Notably, the adjacent slopes that flanked the avalanche path cracked but didn’t slide because they were less steep. Slope angles matter. The most clear-cut approach to keep yourself and your friends safe is terrain selection, particularly slope angles. The nature of our Persistent Slab problem is that it is difficult to predict and should be managed with a wide margin of error. The takeaway from this unpredictable avalanche problem is captured in the BNSF avalanche safety teams observation: “the poor snowpack structure appears to be widespread with a consolidating slab 1-3+ feet thick resting on top of a sometimes-reactive layer of facets formed back in November.” \\nEducation - Our next Avalanche Awareness presentation is Tuesday, December 13, at Whistling Andy Distillery, Bigfork, and on Wednesday, December 14, at Penco Power Products, Kalispell.

The most straightforward way of dealing with this hazard is to avoid terrain that collects wind-blown snow: the lee sides of ridges and crossloaded gullies and slopes downwind of saddles and passes.

You can enjoy great riding while minimizing your chances of triggering large avalanches that break on buried weak layers or small to large slabs of wind-drifted snow. Bust out that inclinometer - a digital one on your phone or an analog version - and measure slope angles; misjudging is easy but can carry costly consequences.\\xa0\", 'discussion': 'Let\\'s focus on the effects of the winds Tuesday and today, even though our most serious hazard remains triggering slabs that break on buried persistent weak layers. That\\'s because the winds have created a new hazard and may exacerbate the Persistent Slab avalanche problem.\\xa0\\nWind speeds picked up Tuesday morning, with ridgeline weather stations recording hourly averages in the mid to upper teens. That\\'s right about the threshold where winds start drifting snow, and indeed, a party in the Flathead Range reported drifting snow partially filling their uptrack between laps. Sarah and Mark saw only light drifting in the southern Whitefish Range. Both parties described some cracking in the drifted snow. These reports are from mid-elevation terrain, so I\\'m guessing that drifting like this was more extensive at upper elevations, with slabs 1 to 2 feet forming in terrain that collects wind-blown snow. With winds continuing today, I expect these slabs to continue building slowly. They can break wide enough and deep enough to bury or injure a person, so it\\'s wise to avoid them, especially when there\\'s plenty of great riding in softer snow on wind-sheltered slopes. If you get into upper elevation terrain today, let us know if you found these slabs.\\nNow for the \"exacerbate the Persistent Slab avalanche problem\" part. The complications come in two main ways. The first is that where the freshly-formed wind slabs have formed on slopes riddled with the November weak layers, the increased load can make initiating slides easier. And the size of triggered slides, larger. So a small wind slab can have disproportionately serious consequences.\\xa0\\nThe second complication is more subtle. Even small amounts of wind-drifted snow can stiffen the surface of a slab, making it easier to trigger. How much drifting snow? How stiff? Unfortunately, snow science hasn\\'t given us the tools to answer those questions yet. But it\\'s relatively easy to determine when the surface of a slab has been stiffened by the wind. The texture looks different - a little dappled or scalloped, with maybe some conifer needles on the surface. And it\\'ll feel a little thicker and denser as you move through it.\\xa0\\nMore importantly, you can have your fill of great riding with little exposure to Wind or Persistent slab avalanche hazards, by sticking to wind-sheltered slopes less than 35 degrees. You can increase your margin of safety by sticking to slopes closer to 30 degrees that don\\'t have steeper convexities. It\\'s easy to underestimate slope angles, so use an inclinometer. And a modified version of that carpenter\\'s adage: measure twice, ride again. Slope angle, slope angle... that\\'s going to be the refrain for a while until the November facets strengthen.\\nEducation - Our next Avalanche Awareness presentation is tonight, December 7, at Whistling Andy Distillery, Bigfork.

The second is that the easiest access to the backcountry is to familiar places that we don't associate with avalanche danger. Like, say, our favorite runs at Whitefish Mountain Resort, which are no different than backcountry slopes right now due to lack of avalanche mitigation. Or the small, steep play areas without previous snowmachine traffic. 2 of the 3 incidents this week occurred in those situations.\\xa0\\nSo travel with a mindset that conditions are unusual and unpredictable. Check the condition of your rescue gear and carry all of it (beacon, shovel, probe, and airbag). Look above you for steep slides that could clobber you with debris if triggered from below. Look below you for terrain and trauma traps.\\xa0\\nCheck out our new Observation View page. It highlights signs of instability and allows you to filter by date or zone, so you can pull out reports relevant to your objectives. We've updated our observation submission page as well. Try it out and help your community by sharing what you see in the backcountry. The form requires you to fill out the location fields and put a dot on a map. Be as vague or specific as you want.\\xa0\\nPreseason restrictions on uphill travel are in effect at Whitefish Mountain Resort.\\xa0\"}\n",
