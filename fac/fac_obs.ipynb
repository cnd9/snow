We decided to not ski Chicken Bone, and simply skin back up to Ghoulie Point where we dropped the west aspect back to around tbar area.

Will be updated as info is gathered. FAC plans to visit the site Monday. 2/19.\\nSummary: \\nA skier triggered a slide that caught another member of the party below. The victim was carried through small trees and came to rest partially buried and injured. The party administered first aid and alerted EMS (InReach and cell phone call from ridge). EMS received the call at 16:50 and dispatched Two Bear Air. Two Bear inserted a Deputy and then extracted both the victim and the deputy from the scene. They transferred the patient to an air ambulance at Hungry Horse Reservoir (the patient was able to walk between helicopters). The patient was hospitalized overnight and treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries.\\nPreliminary events and details:\\nTwo parties of 2 left the Izaak Walton trailhead planning on summitting and skiing Mt. Adams on the crest of the Flathead Range. They left at different times and were unaware of each other's plans. The first party approached across Marion Lake with a descent off the south ridge of Pt. 7798 into Essex Creek. This large avalanche path has numerous names, including Marion's Big Mouth. The second pair approached up Essex Creek.\\nThe parties met on the uptrack to Mt. Adams and skied the east face of the peak as a single group without incident (it had also been skied the previous day). They then climbed out of the Alameda Lake Basin in Essex Creek to the south ridge of Pt. 7798 above Marion Lake. The east-facing slope above the lake is sometimes known as Peanut Butter Bowl. It had been skied the day prior by at least two riders and by at least six riders earlier in the day of the accident. Another party skied steeper, southeast-facing slopes to skier's left about 90 minutes before the accident. That party reported conducting an ECT that broke but did not propagate at a storm interface roughly a foot below the snow surface.\\nOn the ridge, the group of four split into 2 parties comprised of 1 member from each of the original groups. The two parties were equipped with radios, and avalanche rescue gear. One pair (Riders 3 and 4) planned to ski the concave, east-facing slope with existing tracks (Peanut Butter Bowl). The other pair (Riders 1 and 2) chose a line to skier's right that is northeast facing, with a steep, convex entry. Rider 1 skied the upper part of the slope with no incident. They stopped below the run.\\nRider 2 entered the slope and triggered a large, soft slab avalanche. Rider 1 alerted the rest of the group of the slide and watched Rider 2 ski off the slab to skier's left. Unfortunately, this did not give them time to escape the debris rushing down at them. The debris carried Rider 1 roughly 50 meters through some small trees. They came to a rest mostly on the snow surface (legs buried). Rider 1 did not lose consciousness. Rider 1 was able to make brief radio contact with the rest of the group. They lost a ski and pole. The slide occurred at about 16:30.\\nRider 3 stayed on the ridge where they had cell service. Riders 2 and 4 rode down to Rider 1, where they assessed the victim and planned a rescue. They decided Rider 2 would look for the victim's lost gear while Rider 4 assessed and stabilized the victim, whose symptoms included arm, chest, and back pain. After 5 minutes or so, the group decided against self evacuating due to the back pain and potential for further injury. They alerted EMS via InReach and cell phone.\\nEMS received notification at 16:50 and launched Two Bear Air. They inserted a deputy, then extracted the victim and deputy. They transferred the patient to an air ambulance at Hungry Horse Reservoir (The patient was able to walk between helicopters). The patient was hospitalized overnight and treated for serious but not life-threatening injuries. Riders 2, 3, and 4 self evacuated.\\nOne member of the party cited several factors that contributed to the accident:\\n\\nConfirmation bias - they'd skied a larger, more consequential line earlier in the day (Mt. Adams) and there were other tracks nearby.\\nComplacency and fatigue: it was late in the day, and the riders were tired. The 4 riders had already skinned over 7000 vertical feet.\\n\\nThe avalanche was a large avalanche (D2.5) that likely failed on old snow - either an interface between storms or a thin layer of facets a few inches above the Feb. 3 ice/ crust layer. The slab may have been composed partly of wind-drifted snow. It released at roughly 7100 feet on a convex, upper elevation, shaded slope. The debris stopped mid path, at about 6400 feet, after covering part of the uptrack set in Peanut Butter Bowl the day before and used by other parties the day of the accident.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe avalanche forecast for Feb. 15-17\\xa0 listed a Persistent Slab avalanche problem in terrain with these characteristics, with a Moderate (L2) avalanche danger. The party was riding one at a time, though Rider 1 did not stop in a safe zone. Their response to their accident was exemplary.\\nTwo other near-misses occurred the same afternoon on shaded, upper elevation slopes in the next drainage north.\", 'SIGNS OF INSTABILITY': 'Avalanches Observed  Avalanches Triggered  Caught in Avalanche', 'Latitude': '48.402214', 'Longitude': '-114.13365'}\n",

This avalanche was a near-miss and we are very fortunate that nobody was caught or carried in it. This avalanche fractured with the third skier on the slope at the skier's skis and ran full track through a convoluted avalanche path. Our group made several mistakes that we hope to learn from:1. We did not complete a last minute check quick pit/ECT - we probably would have gotten a result that would have turned us back2. We were path dependent - it was the end of a long day and this was the most direct skiable path back to our sleds3. We were not familiar with the complete run - it wasn't a run we would have enjoyed much even without the avalanche and felt very unsafe in retrospectWe were aware of the persistent slab problem (thank you Mark and Sarah) and discussed it at the beginning of the day then tested and looked through it during our tour - except on that final slope. That was a key mistake that could have had dire consequences for us.

The snow was remarakably better than we had anticipated, winds were very light, no gusts, and the snow fell on and off throughout the day.  There was 20 cm of new snow that, above 6000', sat on a supportive surface.  We traveled from 5600' to 7000' and had progressively deeper new snow that made for excellent skiing.  A far cry from our experience in the Middle Fork last weekend.Digging did reavel the deeper persistent layer, which we had react with hard force.  At 6900' on a SE aspect we found a 10 cm thick ice crust (finger hard) starting 60 cm down.  On a column test it failed on CT6 on top of the ice crust (60 cm down).  On an ECT we found ECT26, failing below the layer, 70 cm down.  No propogation, HS 105 cm.  The 20-30 cm sitting on the ground seemed pretty saturated & frozen, but there was another 20-30 cm of very weak facets sitting above that, beneath the ice crust described above.Our friends dug a pit at the same elevation on a NE aspect and did not have the persistent layer react during tests, until they really started wailing on their ECT.  Their pit was 135 cm deep.For what it's worth, the top 20 cm of snow was certainly reactive in both pits - CT8, ECT4, ECT11.  We stuck to lower-angle, straigtforward terrain and didn't have any issues whatsoever with snow moving.  The new snow was on the denser, hero-y side.  All in all the touring was good medicine after the last couple weekends, and so much better than we had expected.

The leader had set an anchor and belay on the climber\\'s right side of the gully, below where it forks. The 2nd a was partway up the pitch on a relatively easy snow slope, also on the climber\\'s right side of the gully.\\nThe 2nd climber reported seeing a powder cloud blooming overhead. The debris ran below him in the gully.\\xa0\\nA second, much larger slide followed very quickly after. The 2nd climber took two steps to escape the debris but couldn\\'t climb out of the gully. He crouched and anchored himself with his tools.\\nThe debris from the slide washed over the 2nd climber for roughly a minute. It pushed him downhill and when he came tight against the rope, it folded him over, ribs against pelvis.

They left the trailhead before reading the day\\'s avalanche forecast, which rated the danger as Low (Level 1 of 5) at all elevations and identified Wind Slabs as the primary avalanche problem (possible, D1-1.5).\\nOn Dec. 23rd, wind sensors at the nearest weather stations (Sperry Glacier and Garden Wall) were rimed so no wind speed measurements are available for the hours leading up to the accident.

The Sperry trail is largely bare or with modest, faceted accumulations for a long ways. Surface hoar present. We switched to skis around 6k ft. One of our primary concerns was solar input on the south facing slopes of Mt Edwards, which carry far more potential than you can see while under them. While we did see some minimal rollerball action, it never warmed enough during the day to initiate any kind of loose wet problem although one small slide had done this at some point in the past and reached the summer trail in the basin above the chalet.All slopes we traveled on had some form of crust. SW aspects this from solar melt and refreeze and it wasn’t much fun to ski. Wind had transported some soft snow into harder lenses with varying distribution  atop this crust in the areas above 6500ft. Primary direction for this west of the pass was from the SW, while we found the opposite east of Comeau Pass. These lenses could be over a foot thick in places. We steered clear of the larger ones on the face. At upper elevations (above 8500ft) on north aspects we found a hard, rimed crust that was supportive of body weight and highly textured. The big takeaway for me from a snowpack standpoint: every one of the current snow surfaces we saw can be a culprit once it gets buried and loaded in the next or subsequent storms. We saw light N winds at the pass and glacier basin. Skies above the inversion were clear.
